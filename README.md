# Automated-Resume-Screening-and-Candidate-Matching
Automated Resume Screening and Candidate Matching Using Natural Language Processing (NLP)

# This project aims to create an application that matches resumes to a given job description by calculating a match score for each resume. The user can input a job description and specify the number of top resumes they want to see. The resumes are then ranked based on their match score, and the top results are displayed in a user-friendly Gradio interface.

Understanding the Problem

The goal is to help recruiters or hiring managers automatically find the most relevant resumes for a given job description. This can save time compared to manually sorting through resumes.
The task is essentially a text classification or similarity problem where we compare a piece of text (resume) to another piece of text (job description) and assign a similarity score.

Choosing the Technology Stack

BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers): We use BERT, a powerful transformer-based model, to process natural language text. BERT is particularly good at understanding context in text, making it suitable for comparing resumes and job descriptions.
Gradio: We use Gradio for building the user interface. Gradio provides an easy way to create web-based interfaces to interact with machine learning models.

Loading the Data

Resumes: Resumes are stored in a CSV file where each row contains a resume’s text. The goal is to iterate through each resume, calculate how well it matches the job description, and rank them accordingly.
Job Description: The user will input a job description through the Gradio interface, which will be compared to the resumes.

Calculating the Match Score

Tokenization: We use BERT’s tokenizer to convert both the resumes and job description into tokens (numerical representations). This is necessary because machine learning models cannot process raw text directly.
BERT Model: The BERT model is used to compare the tokenized text of the resumes with the job description. It outputs logits, which we can convert into probabilities to determine how closely the resume matches the job description.
Softmax: We apply a softmax function to the logits to get probabilities. The second value in the probability array is considered the match score, representing how well the resume matches the job description as a percentage.

Sorting and Ranking the Resumes

Once we have the match scores for all resumes, we sort them in descending order, with the highest scores indicating the best matches.
The user specifies how many of the top resumes they want to see (e.g., the top 10 resumes). We retrieve and display the corresponding number of resumes based on their scores.

Building the User Interface

Gradio Interface: We design a simple Gradio interface where the user can input:
The job description.
The number of top resumes to display.
The interface allows the user to interact with the machine learning model without needing any programming knowledge.
Customization: We customize the interface to improve usability by adding labels, placeholder text, and a slider (or textbox) to allow the user to select the number of resumes to be displayed.

Displaying the Results

After calculating the match scores and sorting the resumes, we display the top N resumes (as specified by the user) along with their corresponding match scores.
The resumes are truncated to a readable size (e.g., 500 characters) to provide a preview, and the full text can be explored if necessary.

Key NLP Concepts:

Tokenization: BERT tokenizes and transforms resumes and job descriptions into structured data for comparison.
Contextual Understanding: BERT captures the context and meaning of words, ensuring accurate comparisons between resumes and job descriptions.
Semantic Text Matching: BERT computes semantic similarity between resumes and job descriptions, helping rank resumes based on relevance.
Text Classification: The model performs a classification task by assigning a match score that represents how well a resume fits the job description.
Information Retrieval: The project ranks and retrieves the top resumes, similar to how search engines retrieve relevant documents.
Named Entity Recognition (NER): Potential use of NER to extract key entities like job titles and skills for better matching.

By using these NLP techniques, the project automates the process of comparing resumes to job descriptions, significantly improving efficiency in the hiring process.
